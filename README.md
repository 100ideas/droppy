# droppy [![](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/droppy.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/droppy) [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/licence-bsd-blue.svg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/silverwind/droppy/master/LICENSE) [![](http://img.shields.io/npm/dm/droppy.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/droppy)

`droppy` is a self-hosted file storage server with an interface similar to desktop file managers and has capabilites to edit files as well as view media directly in the browser. It is especially well suited to be ran on low-end hardware like the Raspberry Pi.

### Features (try the <a target="_blank" href="https://droppy.silverwind.io">demo</a>)
* Fully responsive HTML5 interface
* Multi-file and folder upload
* Realtime updates of changes
* Side-by-Side mode
* Share public download links
* Zip download of folders
* Convenient editor for text files
* Image and video gallery, audio player
* Drag & drop and swipe gestures
* Fullscreen support

### Installation
Note that two directories will be used for file system access:

- `config` directory: set with `--configdir <dir>`, default `~/.droppy/config`.
- `files` directory: set with `--filesdir <dir>`, default `~/.droppy/files`.

#### Local Installation
With [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org) >= 0.10 and `npm` installed, run:

```sh
# Install latest version and dependencies.
$ [sudo] npm install -g droppy

# Start with `/srv/droppy/config` for config and `/srv/droppy/files` for files.
$ droppy start --configdir /srv/droppy/config --filesdir /srv/droppy/files

# Open http://localhost:8989/ in your browser.
```

#### Docker installation :whale:
```sh
# Create directories for the volumes. These are mounted inside the container in the next step.
$ mkdir -p /srv/droppy/config
$ mkdir -p /srv/droppy/files

# Start the container, forwarding port 8989 on the host.
$ docker run --name droppy -p 8989:8989 -v /srv/droppy/config:/config -v /srv/droppy/files:/files silverwind/droppy

# Open http://localhost:8989/ in your browser.
```
*Note: While it's adviceable that all files in the `config` and `files` directory are owned by the user running the application, changing the ownership of files is supported through passing  the environment variables `UID` and `GID` to the container, e.g. `docker run -e UID=1000 -e GID=1000`.*

### Configuration
By default, the server listens on all IPv4 and IPv6 interfaces on port 8989. On first startup, a prompt to create login data for the first account will appear. Once it's created, login credentials are enforced. Additional accounts can be created in the options interface or the command line. Configuration is done in `config/config.json`, which is created with these defaults:

```javascript
{
  "listeners" : [
      {
          "host"     : ["0.0.0.0", "::"],
          "port"     : 8989,
          "protocol" : "http"
      }
  ],
  "public"          : false,
  "timestamps"      : true,
  "linkLength"      : 5,
  "logLevel"        : 2,
  "maxFileSize"     : 0,
  "updateInterval"  : 1000,
  "pollingInterval" : 0,
  "keepAlive"       : 20000
}
```

### Options
- `listeners` *Array* - Defines on which network interfaces, port and protocols the server will listen. See [listener options](#listener-options) below. `listeners` has no effect when droppy is used as a module.
- `public` *Boolean* - When enabled, no user authentication is performed.
- `timestamps` *Boolean* - When enabled, adds timestamps to log output.
- `linkLength` *Number* - The amount of characters in a shared link.
- `logLevel` *Number* - Logging amount. `0` is no logging, `1` is errors, `2` is info (HTTP requests), `3` is debug (Websocket communication).
- `maxFileSize` *Number* - The maximum file size in bytes a user can upload in a single file.
- `updateInterval` *Number* - Interval in milliseconds in which a single client can receive update messages through changes in the file system.
- `pollingInterval` *Number* - Interval in milliseconds in which the file system is polled for changes, which is likely **necessary for files on external or network-mapped drives**. This is CPU-intensive! Corresponds to chokidar's [usePolling](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar#performance) option. `0` disables polling.
- `keepAlive` *Number* - Interval in milliseconds in which the server sends keepalive message over the websocket, which may be necessary with proxies. `0` disables keepalive messages.
- `dev` *Boolean* - Enable developer mode, skipping resource minification and enabling live reload.

#### Listener Options

`listeners` defines on which network interfaces, ports and protocol(s) the server will listen. For example:

```javascript
"listeners": [
    {
        "host"     : [ "0.0.0.0", "::" ],
        "port"     : 80,
        "protocol" : "http"
    },
    {
        "host"     : "0.0.0.0",
        "port"     : 443,
        "protocol" : "https",
        "key"      : "~/certs/tls.key",
        "cert"     : "~/certs/tls.crt",
        "ca"       : "~/certs/tls.ca",
        "dhparam"  : "~/certs/tls.dhparam",
        "hsts"     : 31536000
    }
]
```
The above configuration will result in:
- HTTP listening on all IPv4 and IPv6 interfaces, port 80.
- HTTPS listening on all IPv4 interfaces, port 443, with 1 year of HSTS duration, using the provided SSL/TLS files.

A listener object accepts these options:
- `host` *String/Array* - Network interface(s) to listen on. Required.
- `port` *Number/Array* - Network port(s) to listen on. Required.
- `protocol` *String* - Protocol to use, `http` or `https`. Required.

For SSL/TLS these additional options are available:
- `key` *String* - Path to PEM-encoded SSL/TLS private key file. Required.
- `cert` *String* - Path to PEM-encoded SSL/TLS certificate file. Required.
- `ca` *String* - Path to PEM-encoded SSL/TLS intermediate certificate file.
- `dhparam` *String* - Path to PEM-encoded SSL/TLS Diffie-Hellman parameters file. If not provided, new 2048 bit parameters will generated and saved for future use.
- `hsts` *Number* - Length of the [HSTS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security) header in seconds. Set to `0` to disable HSTS.

*Note: Unless given absolute, SSL/TLS paths are relative to the config folder. If your certificate file includes an concatenated intermediate certificate, it will be detected and used, there's no need to specify `ca` in this case.*

### API
droppy can be used with frameworks like [express](https://github.com/strongloop/express):
```js
var app    = require("express")();
var droppy = require("droppy")({
  configdir: "~/droppy/config"
  filesdir: "~/droppy/files",
  log: "~/droppy/log",
  logLevel: 0
});

app.use("/", droppy);
app.listen(process.env.PORT || 8989);
```
See the [express example](https://github.com/silverwind/droppy/blob/master/examples/express.js) for a working example.

#### droppy([options])
- **options** {object}: [Options](#Options). Extends [config.json](#Configuration). In addition to above listed options, `configdir`, `filesdir` and `log` are present on the API.

Returns `function onRequest(req, res)`. All arguments are optional.

#### Upgrading a local installation
```sh
$ [sudo] npm install -g droppy
```

#### Upgrading a Docker installation
```sh
$ docker pull silverwind/droppy
$ docker stop droppy
$ docker rm droppy
$ docker run --name droppy -p 8989:8989 -v /srv/droppy/config:/config -v /srv/droppy/files:/files silverwind/droppy
```

### Note about startup performance
droppy is currently optimized for a moderate amount of files. To aid in performance, all directories are indexed into memory once on startup. The downside of this is that the startup will take considerable time on slow storage with hunderts of thousands of files present.

### Note about wget
For correct download filenames of shared links, use `--content-disposition` or add this to `~/.wgetrc`:

```ini
content-disposition = on
