# droppy [![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/droppy.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/droppy) [![Dependency Status](http://img.shields.io/david/silverwind/droppy.svg?style=flat)](https://david-dm.org/silverwind/droppy) [![Downloads per month](http://img.shields.io/npm/dm/droppy.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/droppy)

droppy is a self-hosted cloud server with an interface similar to desktop file managers and has capabilites to edit files on-the-fly as well as view and playback media directly in the browser. It focuses on performance and intuitive usage. It can run both standalone or through express. To provide realtime updates, most communication is done through WebSockets. A demo is available <a target="_blank" href="http://droppy.silverwind.io">here</a>.

### Features
* Fully responsive HTML5 interface
* Multi-file and folder upload
* Realtime updates of changes
* Share public download links
* Zip download of folders
* Image and video gallery, audio player
* Drag & drop and swipe gesture support
* Fullscreen support
* Edit text files in a heavily customized CodeMirror
* Supports latest node.js/io.js (min: 0.10) and all modern browsers

### Installation
```
$ [sudo] npm install -g droppy
$ droppy start
```

To store configuration and files, these two directories will be used:

- `~/.droppy`: configuration directory. Override with `--configdir`.
- `~/.droppy/files`: files directory. Override with `--filesdir`.

By default, the server listens on [http://localhost:8989/](http://localhost:8989/). On first startup, a prompt for username and password for the first account will appear.

### Configuration
Run `droppy config` to edit `config/config.json`, which is created with these defaults:
```javascript
{
  "listeners" : [
      {
          "host"     : ["0.0.0.0", "::"],
          "port"     : 8989,
          "protocol" : "http"
      }
  ],
  "debug"          : false,
  "keepAlive"      : 20000,
  "linkLength"     : 5,
  "logLevel"       : 2,
  "maxFileSize"    : 0,
  "public"         : false,
  "timestamps"     : true,
  "updateInterval" : 1000
}
```
### Options
- `listeners` {Array} - Defines on which interfaces, port and protocols the server will listen. See the details of the [listener object](#listener-object) below. `listeners` has no effect when droppy is used as a module.
- `debug` {Boolean} - When enabled, skips resource minification and enables CSS reloading.
- `keepAlive` {Number} - The interval in milliseconds in which the server sends keepalive message over the websocket. These messages add some overhead but may be needed with proxies are involved. Set to `0` to disable keepalive messages.
- `linkLength` {Number} - The amount of characters in a share link.
- `logLevel` {Number} - Logging amount. `0` is no logging, `1` is errors, `2` is info (HTTP requests), `3` is debug (Websocket communication).
- `maxFileSize` {Number} - The maximum file size in bytes a user can upload in a single file.
- `public` {Boolean} - When enabled, no authentication is performed.
- `timestamps` {Boolean} - When enabled, adds timestamps to log output.
- `updateInterval` {Number} - Interval in which a single client can receive updates through changes in the file system, in milliseconds.

### Listener Object

`listeners` defines on which interfaces, ports and protcol the server will listen. For example:

```javascript
"listeners": [
    {
        "host"     : [ "0.0.0.0", "::" ],
        "port"     : 80,
        "protocol" : "http"
    },
    {
        "host"     : "0.0.0.0",
        "port"     : 443,
        "protocol" : "https",
        "hsts"     : 31536000,
        "key"      : "config/tls.key",
        "cert"     : "config/tls.crt",
        "ca"       : "config/tls.ca",
        "dhparam"  : "config/tls.dhparam"
    }
]
```
The above configuration will result in:
- HTTP listening on all IPv4 and IPv6 interfaces, port 80.
- HTTPS listening on all IPv4 interfaces, port 443, with 1 year of HSTS duration, using the provided SSL/TLS files.

A listener object accepts these options:
- `host` {String/Array} - Network interface(s) to listen on. Use an array for multiple interfaces.
- `port` {Number/Array} - Port(s) to listen on. Use an array for multiple ports.
- `protocol` {String} - Protocol to use, `http` or `https`.
- `hsts` {Number} - Length of the [HSTS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security) header in seconds. Set to `0` to disable HSTS.
- `key` {String} - Path to the SSL/TLS private key file. If ommitted, uses self-generated key.
- `cert` {String} - Path to the SSL/TLS certificate file. If ommitted, uses self-signed certificate.
- `ca` {String} - Path to the SSL/TLS intermediate certificate file. Optional.
- `dhparam` {String} - Path to the SSL/TLS Diffie Hellman parameters file. Optional. If ommitted, new 2048 bit parameters will created and saved for later use.

*Note: SSL/TLS paths are relative to the home folder, but can be defined as absolute too. If your certificate file includes an intermediate certificate, it will be detected and used. There's no need to specify `ca` in this case.*

### API
droppy can be used with [express](https://github.com/strongloop/express) like this:
```js
var app    = require("express")();
var droppy = require("droppy")({
  configdir: "~/droppy/config"
  filesdir: "~/droppy/files",
  log: "~/droppy/log",
  logLevel: 0
});

app.use("/", droppy).listen(process.env.PORT || 8989);
```
See the [commented express example](https://github.com/silverwind/droppy/blob/master/examples/express.js) for a working example.

#### droppy([options])
- **options** {object}: [Options](#Options). Extends [config.json](#Configuration). In addition to above listed options, `configdir`, `filesdir` and `log` are present on the API.

Returns `function onRequest(req, res)`. All arguments are optional.

### wget
For correct filenames of shared links, use `--content-disposition` or add this to `~/.wgetrc`:

```ini
content-disposition = on
```
